# odin-recipes
This is a simple HTML project to put to the test all the HTML skills that I have learned in the Foundations course of The Odin Project.

Through this project I have used use the next HTML elements:
    *Paragraphs (<p>)
    *HTML lists (<ul>, <ol> and <li>)
    *Images (<img>)
    *Links (<a>)


The finality of this project is to build a main HTML page with links to three recipes using the correct relative paths to achieve a very simple but efficient navigation.
