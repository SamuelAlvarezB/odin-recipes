    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is sort of a Spanish ratatouille, a vegetable stew that hails from La Mancha. Serve with with a fried egg on top and some crusty bread for a lovely and light meat-free meal!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>6 medium tomatoes - blanched, peeled, and chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>a generous pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 medium green bell peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add tomatoes, sugar, and salt and cook for 5 minutes. Blend with an immersion blender until smooth.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium-low. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add bell peppers, zucchini, and onion. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomato mixture into the vegetable mixture and stir until well combined. Cook, stirring occasionally, for an additional 15 minutes. Taste and season with salt, if needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs into the skillet and cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until whites are completely set, about 4 minutes.</li>
