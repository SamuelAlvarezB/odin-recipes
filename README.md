# odin-recipes
This is a simple HTML project to put to the test all the HTML skills that I have learned in the Foundations course of The Odin Project.

Through this project I have used use the next HTML elements:
    *Paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;)
    *HTML lists (&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt;)
    *Images (&lt;img&gt;)
    *Links (&lt;a&gt;)
    *Headings (&lt;h1&gt;...&lt;h6&gt;)


The finality of this project is to build a main HTML page with links to three recipes using the correct relative paths to achieve a very simple but efficient navigation.
